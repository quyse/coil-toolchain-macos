# Notice

This is a small tool from [rebeccajae/plist2json](https://github.com/rebeccajae/plist2json). The repo is not public anymore, so I copied it here. Nix configuration is added by me.

There follows the original `README.md`.

# `plist2json`
This is just a tool I thought would exist natively. It doesn't.

It takes a plist input from stdin and spits it back out on stdout as json.

Dunno what else you want. The name is kinda self-explanatory.

## Installation
```bash
go get github.com/rebeccajae/plist2json
```

## Usage
```bash
cat some.plist | plist2json
```
